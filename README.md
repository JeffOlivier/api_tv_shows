# TV Show Search

![Page Image](./public/images/tvshows.png)

## Purpose

This is an app that I created to demonstrate the use of:

- React
- Local state management
- Multiple React components
- Passing state and pointers to functions to child components
- Accessing URL parameters
- Responsive CSS Grid
- Modular Sass
- JavaScript ES6
- JavaScript Fetch API with async/await
- ~~React Router~~
- ~~React Hooks~~
- ~~Helmet to inject meta into the &lt;head&gt;~~

[Working Demo]http://tvshows.jeffolivier.codes

## How to use this app

Type a search term in the search box and after 1 second (1000 ms), an API call to api.tvmaze.com will be made and return a list of the top 10 shows based on relevance to your search term. You can then click on the **_EPISODES_** button to get a list of all the show's episodes broken out by season.
